Despite its age, PHP is still a commonly used technology in web development.

PHP is designed to interact with HTML to generate dynamic websites.

Embedding PHP in HTML is done by placing PHP code between <?php and ?> tags.

Every statement in PHP must be terminated with a semicolon ;.

PHP files have a .php extension and the file always starts with the opening PHP tag <?php. The closing tag is implied and left out by 
convention.

Whitespace is generally ignored when executing PHP code.

Keywords are not case sensitive in PHP. As a convention, use the standard casing.

Single line comments are made in PHP using # or //. Multi-line comments are placed between /* and */.
